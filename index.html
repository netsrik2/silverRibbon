        <h1>Silver ribbon project</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p>When cancer sufferers fight, recover and go into remission we laud their bravery. We wear ribbons to celebrate their fight. We call them survivors. Because they are.</p>
            <p>When depression sufferers fight, recover and go into remission we seldom even know, simply
        because so many suffer in the dark... ashamed to admit something they see as a personal weakness...afraid that people will worry
        and more afraid that they won’t. We find ourselves unable to do anything but cling to the couch and force ourselves to breathe.
        When you come out of depression there is an incredible relief, but not one you feel allowed to celebrate. Instead the feeling of
        victory is replaced with anxiety that it will happen again, and with shame and vulnerability when you see how your illness affected
        your family, your work, everything left untouched while you struggled to survive. We come back to life as survivors. Survivors who
        don’t get pats on the back from coworkers who congratulate them on making it. Survivors who wake to more work than before
        because their friends and family are exhausted from helping them fight a battle they may not even understand.
        I hope to one day see a sea of people all wearing silver ribbons as a sign that they understand the secret battle, and as a
        celebration of the victories made each day as we individually pull ourselves out of our foxholes to see our scars heal and to
        remember what the sun looks like.</p>
        <p>I hope one day to be better, and I’m pretty sure I will be. I hope one day I live in a world where the personal fight for mental
        stability is viewed with pride and public cheers instead of shame. I hope it for you too.
        But until then, it starts slowly.
        I haven’t hurt myself in three days. I sing strange battle songs to myself in the darkness to scare away the demons. I am a fighter
        when I need to be.
        And for that I am proud.
        I celebrate every one of you reading this. I celebrate the fact that you’ve fought your battle and continue to win. I celebrate the
        fact that you may not understand the battle but you pick up the baton dropped by someone you love until they can carry it again.
        I survived and I remind myself that each time we go through this, we get a little stronger. We learn new tricks on the battlefield.
        We learn them in terrible ways but we use them. We don’t struggle in vain. We win. We are alive.</p>
